# How to **Build a Blog** using a **GitHub Pages Site**?

> A hands-on, beginner-friendly guide for developers and students

Hello, all 👋

Ever wanted a place to share your projects or notes online without learning full-stack development?  

Then You're in the right place!  

In this tutorial, we'll create a clean, customizable blog using **GitHub Pages** and **Jekyll** for free.  
No design skills, server setup, or backend knowledge required.

Let’s get started!!

---

### What You'll Need:
 - A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account 
 - A little Markdown knowledge (don't worry, we'll cover it)
 - A Jekyll theme you like

---

### 1. Choose a Jekyll Theme

I’m guessing you already have a GitHub account — but if not, create one first 👉 [GitHub](https://github.com/)

Done? Let's get started.

Head over to the [Jekyll Theme Gallery](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme)  
Pick a theme that fits your vibe. Minimal, academic, colorful, retro... whatever.

</div>  

In this tutorial, We’ll use the [`academicpages`](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages), which is great for portfolios, blogs, and even resumes.  

---

### 2. Fork the Repository

Once you've chosen a theme:

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step2.png" alt="Click Fork" width="600">
</div>

- Click the **Fork** in the top-right corner of the theme repository.
- Rename the forked repo to match this format: `yourusername.github.io`   

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step3.png" alt="Rename your Repo name" width="600">
</div>  

✅ This naming is important! It tells GitHub to publish your site automatically.  
(I already have a blog, so I'll create this one as a test!)

---

### 3. Configure `_config.yml`

In your new(forked) repository, find and open the `_config.yml` file.  

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step4.png" alt="Where's _config.yml?" width="600">
</div>  

Update the following lines:

```yaml
url: "https://yourusername.github.io"
baseurl: ""
```

You can also edit your blog’s title, description, author, and social links here.  

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step5.png" alt="Commit changes..." width="600">
</div>  

Take a moment to make it yours. Once you're done, commit changes.

---

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages

Now let’s publish the site!

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step6.png" alt="Edit 'Pages'" width="600">
</div>  

1. Go to your repo’s **Settings** tab. 
2. Click **Pages** in the left sidebar.
3. Set the following options:
   - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch**: `main` or `master`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**

That’s it. GitHub will now build and publish your site.  
Afer a few seconds, you'll see a URL like: `https://yourusername.github.io`  

---

### 5. Write Your First Post

Time to write your very first blog post.

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step7-0.png" alt="Create new file'" width="600">
</div>  

1. In your repo, click **Add file → Create new file**
2. Name your file in the following format:  
`_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`  

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step7.png" alt="Write post" width="600">
</div>  

3. In the editor, copy and paste the following sample content:  

```markdown
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2025-07-24
layout: post
---

Hello, world!

Write anything what you want!
```  
4. Click **Commit changes...**  

Your post should now appear on your blog homepage.  

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step8.png" alt="Write post" width="600">
</div>  

✅ **Tip & Troubleshooting**  
> Make sure your filename follows the correct format: `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
 - It must start with a valid date.
 - It must end with `.md`.
> Want images?
 - Upload images into the `/assets/img/` folder and use standard Markdown: `![Alt text](/assets/img/example.png)`  

---

DONE!  

You've now created very first blog, powered by GitHub and Jekyll.
