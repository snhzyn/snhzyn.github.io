# How to **create** a **GitHub Pages Site**?

> This post is a beginner's guide to starting with GitHub pages.

Hello, all.

If you're looking to create a personal website as a developer, **GitHub Pages** is a great choice. 
It's ~~notorious~~ for being tricky at first, but if you follow these steps, you'll have a simple site up and running in no time!  

In this post, we'll cover:
  - Creating a **repository**
  - Enabling GitHub pages in **settings**
  - Adding your first post as **'_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md'**

---

### 1. Create a Repository

Iâ€™m guessing you already have a GitHub account â€” but if not, create one first ðŸ‘‰ [GitHub](https://github.com/)

Done? Let's get started.

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step1.png" alt="Step1" width="600">
</div>

Click the `Create repository` button at the top-right corner.

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step2.png" alt="Step2" width="600">
</div>

Here, you need to configure three things:

- **Repository name**  
  In the input field, enter your GitHub username followed by `.github.io`  
  _Example: `snhzyn.github.io`_
- **Visibility: Public**  
  Making your repository public allows others to view your site.
- **Add a README file**  
  It's recommended to add a `README`. This helps avoid issues when cloning or pulling an empty repository.

Now youâ€™ve created your first repo (short for repository ðŸ˜Š)!  
Letâ€™s keep going!

### 2. Make GitHub Pages Live

Now that you've created your repo, it's time to activate GitHub Pages and make your site go live! 

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step3.png" alt="Step3" width="600">
</div>

Click the `Settings` tab.

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step4.png" alt="Step4" width="600">
</div>

Scroll down to the **Pages** section in the left sidebar and check the following:

- **Source**: Select **Deploy from a branch**
- **Branch**: Choose `main`, then `/ (root)`

Click **Save**.

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step5.png" alt="Step5" width="600">
</div>

Once saved, GitHub will start building your site.  
Within a few seconds (or maybe a minute), youâ€™ll see a message like: `https://username.github.io/`

Click the link and boom â€” your website is live! ðŸŽ‰

### 3. Write a first post

If youâ€™ve made it this far, youâ€™re almost done!  df
Letâ€™s push through and finish strong.

<div align="center">
 <img src="/assets/img/task1/step6.png" alt="Step6" width="600">
</div>

In your repository, click **Add file â†’ Create new file**.
  
<!-- Photo_step7 -->

Youâ€™ll see a blank white editor (Do not afraid!). Letâ€™s fill it out:

- **Filename**  
  At the top, enter:
  ```bash
  _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-example.md
  ```
  This creates a `_posts` folder with a Markdown file inside it.
  Make sure to include the full date and title in the filename, or the post wonâ€™t be recognized. And of course, update the date and title to match your own post.
- **Content**
