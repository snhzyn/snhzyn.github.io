# SQL Basics for Beginners

This post summarizes the most frequently used SQL syntax and concepts, including _filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and window functions_, especially helpful when using tools like `pandasql` or `BigQuery`.

## 1. SQL Execution Order

Although SQL queries are typically written in the order of `WITH`, `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, they are logically executed as the following:

```sql
FROM > WHERE > GROUP BY > HAVING > SELECT > DISTINCT > ORDER BY > LIMIT
```

You might not understand what these means yet, but don't worry. We'll cover it soon.

## 2. Filtering with Conditions

### Basic `WHERE` Clause

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows based on specific conditions. Only rows that satisfy the condition will be returned in the result.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE score > 80;
```

In this example, only rows where the `score` is greater than 80 will be selected.

### Logical Operators

Logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `NOT`, and `Between A and B` are used to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause.

```sql
WHERE gender = 'M' AND age Between 20 and 30;
```

This query returns only rows where the gender is male (`'M'`) and the age is between 20 and 30.

```sql
WHERE city IN ('Seoul', 'Busan');
```
This condition filters for rows where the city is either `'Seoul'` or `'Busan'`.

### NULL Check

Use `IS NULL` to filter for rows where a column has no value. This is useful when identifying missing or incomplete data.

```sql
WHERE email IS NULL;
```

This query returns only the rows where the `email` column contains no value. NOTE! It is `NULL` ,not zero or empty string, but truly missing data.

## 3. Sorting and Limiting Results

### Sorting Rows

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. By default, it sorts in ascending order (`ASC`), but you can specify descending order (`DESC`) as well.

```sql
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

This sorts the result by the `score` column in descending order, showing the highest scores first.

### Limiting Output

The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned in the result set. It is especially useful when previewing large datasets.

```sql
LIMIT 10;
```
This returns only the first 10 rows of the result set.
