# How to use Git?

Hello, all. Me again.  

This time, we'll learn how to use **Git** to post on your pages.  

I bet most people know what GitHub is, but Git isn't. Actually Git is a system that created by *Linus Torvalds* who is a.k.a Linux creator.  
It's a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. Often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.  
So.. if you're preparing for a future developer, knowing how to use **Git** must be a great asset.

In this post, we'll cover:
  - Installing **Git**
  - Basic Git **codes**
  - **Adding**, **Committing**, **Pushing**, **Pulling**

## 1. Install Git

## 2. 

If you're using Windows, you should use different commands in Git terminal. 

Let's start with finding where you are. If you command 'cd' as you do on cmd, you can find you are back home. (I didn't wanna know this)  
So, Use the `pwd` command to check where you are.
